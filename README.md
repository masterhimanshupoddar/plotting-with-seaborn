## PLOTTING WITH SEABORN
# This repo contains basic code to plot some of the most commonly used graphs in the real world for exploratory data analysis.
**Graphs that I have covered are : **


* Scatter Plot
* Box Plot
* Violin Plot
* Swarm Plot
* Overlaying plots.
* Heatmap
* Histogram
* Bar Plot
* Factor Plot
* Density Plot
* Joint Distribution Plot

I have also covered some of the things that can make your plot look nicer<br>
Color palettes.<br>
Seaborn themes which can be done using set style. <br>

Although there are many types of graphs that can be plotted with seaborn but here I have mentioned most of the commonly used.
In case of any doubt please leave a comment.
